Fix breadth first so that it doesn't return a subnetwork until all paths are terminated
Inner vs outer subnetworks 
How to quantitatively differentiate between subnetworks?
  --trim off everything that's not part of a cycle and then compare edge sets

look at small networks, look for equivalent networks, kill edges that dont have cycles (look at out degree)
compare differences in subnetworks with  different starting nodes
resialance of the network, based on number of branches vs number of subnetworks 
correlation between number of colors, branching and subnetworks 
why do some have more subnetworks 
adapt code to python to model flow
choose weights between 1/2 and 2
test slight modifications in subnetworks and weights
