Let G be a connected, directed, finite graph.

1) G contains a finite number of subgraphs

pf/ Since each subgraph must be distinct from any other subgraph, and G is finite, there are only finitely many possible subgraphs []

2) The breadth first algorithm will terminate

pf/ The algorithm will terminate when the list of not completed subnetworks is empty. The algorithmm begins with one not completed subnetwork. At each step a maximum of the number of edges connecting to 
the target node are added. Since G is finite this number will be finite. Thus the number of not completed subnetworks is finite. We now show that any not completed subnetwork will terminate after finitely many steps.
WLOG select a single subnetwork from the list of not completed subnetworks. At each step we will add an edge and node to the network until either a leaf is reached, or a cycle is detected. Let k be the length 
of the longest path on G. K must be finite, so after N<=K steps the subnetwork will have been completed []

3) The breadth first approach will yield the same subnetworks as the depth first approach
