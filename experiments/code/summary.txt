Algorithm for detecting subnetworks was created and verified
---Has approximately n^2 complexity
---Number of subnetworks increases as a function of nodes, edges and colors
Algorithm was adapted into a class for use in experiments
Experiments seem to indicate that a both nessecary and sufficient condition for a node going to zero
is membership in subnetwork with spectral radius less than 1.
The Lyaponov numbers of the subnetworks indicate that many are sensitively dependent on initial conditions, but only when tanh is not used
