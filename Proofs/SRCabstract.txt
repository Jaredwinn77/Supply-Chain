The interconnectedness of modern supply chains means that
 slight variations in dynamics can be amplified across the world.
 We consider a network model of supply chain dynamics, based on the 
 limiting principle of minimum production, to predict cascading failures.
 We define a subnetwork of the supply chain network and consider its 
 spectral radius as a mechanism for determining the locations of failures. 
 We describe a novel algorithm for identifying subnetworks which in
 the most pathological cases has complexity O(n^n) but in practice averages
 a more tenable quadratic complexity. 
 We propose another mechanism which results in failures.
