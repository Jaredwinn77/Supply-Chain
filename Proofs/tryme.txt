Identifying mechanisms for zero nodes:
    One color: spectral radius close to 1
    Multiple colors: 
        Structural-- perhaps when a node with two different colors flowing in
    See the effects of perturbing initial conditions
    Can any graph have it?
    Is it caused by only a single factor or multiple?
    Is there one new mechanism or two?
    How can we understand some graphs haveing all nodes go to zero, and some only having a few?
    Can we determine how far the cascade goes, or predict the level of failure 
    (check the inputs of those nodes outside of the zero subnetwork)
    can we show the number of colors increases the number of subenetworks?
    think about changing a color to be a different one
Sensitivity--
    Condtion of the system:
        Calculate how much each perturbation changes the outcome
    Lyaponov Coefficient:
        Similar measures the dependence on initial conditions, can be used to classify the system as chaotic
